一曲新词酒一杯，去年天气旧亭台，夕阳西下几时回？

I compose a new song and drink a cup of wine. In the bower of last year when weather is as fine. When will you come back now the sun’s on the decline?

无可奈何花落去，似曾相识燕归来，小园香径独徘徊。

Deeply I sign for the fallen flowers in vain. Vaguely I seem to know the swallows come again. Loitering on the garden path, I alone remain.
